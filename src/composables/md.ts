# Introduction
This article will focus on the planes, regions, layers, muscles, fascia and other parts of the anterolateral abdominal wall.. Since this is an outline, let's get right into it!

# Quadrants and Regions
To help in locating structures, performing surgeries and other procedures involving the abdomen, It is divided into **4 quadrants** and **9 regions**.

![abdominal regions and quadrants](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Abdominal_Quadrant_Regions.jpg/800px-Abdominal_Quadrant_Regions.jpg)


## Quadrants
The abdomen is divided into its 4 quadrants by one longitudinal(vertical) and one transverse(horizontal) plane:
- Median Plane - A vertical line that divides the body into left and right halves. 
- Transumbilical Plane - A horizontal line that lies roughly halfway between the xiphoid process and the pubic symphysis (halfway of the abdomen). It is usually found at the level of L3 vertebra

The planes are:
1. Right Upper Quadrant - Liver (Right lobe), Gallbladder, Stomach(Pylorus), R. Kidney, Colon(Hepatic Flexure, R. Half of Transverse), Superior portion of R. Ureter, Superior Portion of Duodenum, Pancreas(head).
2. Right Lower Quadrant - Colon(Ascending), Cecum, Appendix, Teminal Ileum, Inferior Portion of R.Ureter, *Bladder and Uterus(if distended), R. Ovary and Ipsilateral Ovarian Duct
3. Left Upper Quadrant - Liver (left lobe), Pancreas(except head), Spleen, Stomach(except Pylorus), L. Kidney, Colon(Splenic Flexure, L. Half of Transverse), Superior portion of L. Ureter, Jejunum, e.t.c.
4. Left Lower Quadrant - Colon(Descending, Sigmoid), Rectum, Inferior Portion of L.Ureter, Part of the Small Intestine, *Bladder and Uterus(if distended), L. Ovary and Ipsilateral Ovarian Duct

> The uterus can extend into all the quadrants during late pregnancy. The bladder can also extend into the lower quadrants when distended

## Regions
The abdomen is also divided into 9 regions by 4 lines: 2 vertical and 2 horizontal. Just like playing tic-tac-toe ðŸ˜œ :

- Midclavicular lines: Two vertical lines drawn vertically from the midclavicular lines to the ipsilateral inguinal ligaments
- Transpyloric line: A horizontal line going through half the distance between jugular notch and public symphysis. Usually at the line of L1 vertebra
- Transtubercular line: A horizontal line going between the iliac tubercules. Usually at the line of L5 vertebra

> Instead of the transpyloric line, the subcostal line can also be used. And also due to the position of the mid clavicular lines, the middle regions are usually **slightly** larger than the lateral ones

> Note: The lumbar regions maybe called the flank regions. The Hypogastric region can also be called the suprapubic region. The inguinal regions may also be sometimes called the iliac regions



# Layers of the Abdomen

From superficial to deep, these are the layers in the anterolateral abdominal wall

![layers of abdomen](https://i.ibb.co/jLnJgKv/abd-wall.png)

1. Skin
2. Fatty Camper's fascia
3. Membraneous Scarper fascia (continuous inferiorly with the superficial perineal or Colles fascia)
4. Superficial investing layer
5. External oblique
6. Intermediate investing layer.
7. Internal Oblique
8. Deep Investing layer
9. Transversus abdominis; next is Rectus Abdominis (anterior only)
10. Transversalis fascia
11. Extraperitoneal fat
12. Parietal peritoneum




# Muscles
The anterolateral abdominal wall contains two kinds of muscles:

1. Vertical muscles
2. Flat muscles

## Flat muscles
There are 3 flat muscles in the abdomen. From superficial to deep they are:
1. External Oblique
2. Internal Oblique, and
3. Transversus Abdominis

![the flat muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall](https://i.ibb.co/1fBtxgv/chrome-Fr-LKddbgwc.png)



> The Linea Alba (L. white line) is a thickened piece of fascia that divides the abdomen into left and right halves. It is formed by the decussation(interweaving) of all three flat muscles.


### External oblique

- Most superficial muscle in the wall
- Originates from _external_ surface of 5th to 12th ribs. 
- Inserts on the public tubercules, the anterior portion of the iliac spine and the linea alba.
- The inferior portion folds on itself,  forming the **Inguinal ligament**
- The medial part is aponeurotic and the lateral part is muscular.
- The posterior part attaches vertically to the Iliac Spine, but the anterior part of the muscle fans out **inferomedially** to attach to the Iliac Spine (Think of the direction of your hands in your pockets)
- Blood Supply: Upper 2/3rds by Posterior Intercostal Arteries. Lower 1/3rd by the Deep Circumflex Iliac A.
- Innervation: By the thoracoabdominal nerves (T7 - T11) and subcostal nerve (T12)
- Functions to help in:
     1. Flexion and rotation of the trunk
    2. Compression of the abdominal viscera - especially during forced expiration
- Lymphatic Drainage: Like the fascia and other structures of the wall, the lymphatic drainage is to the **superficial inguinal lymph nodes**.
- Clinical Correlates: Oblique Strain, Trigger Points, Bilateral Muscle Weakness

> Note that the neurovasculature of the muscles go in between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis

### Internal oblique
- Originates from lateral 1/3rds of inguinal ligament, anterior two thirds of the iliac crest and thoracolumbar fascia.
- Inserts at the linea alba, pubic crest and _inferior_ border of 10th to 12th ribs.
- The fibers go opposite to the external oblique;**superomedially**. 
- Blood Supply: Posterior Intercostal Arteries and Subcostal Artery, Epigastric Arteries, Lumbar Arteries
- Innervation: By the thoracoabdominal nerves (T6 - T11), subcostal nerve (T12) and branches from the L1 plexus
- Functions to help in:
     1. Flexion and rotation of the trunk
    2. Compression of the abdominal viscera - especially during forced expiration

> Note: The oblique muscles act as a flexor unilaterally(alone), but they act as a trunk rotator bilaterally with the contralateral alternate muscle. For example, the _Right External Oblique_ would work with the _Left Internal Oblique_ to bring the _right_ shoulder to the left hip. This is because their fibers are continuous with each other

###  Transversus Abdominis
- Deepest muscle of the three
- Originates from the thoracolumbar fascia, Connective tissue at the lateral 1/3rd of the inguinal ligament, internal surface of 7th to 12th costal cartilages, iliac crest
- Inserts at the linea alba, pubic crest, pecten pubis(via the conjoint tendon)
- Blood Supply: Lower Posterior Intercostal Arteries. Subcostal A., Superior Epigastric A.
- Innervation: By the thoracoabdominal nerves (T6 - T11), subcostal nerve (T12) and branches from the L1 plexus
- Functions to help in compression of the abdominal viscera - especially during forced expiration

> Unlike the first two, this is _NOT_ involved in trunk movement

## Vertical Muscles
These muscles are located purely in the anterior abdominal wall, and they are 2:

1. Rectus Abdominis
2. Pyramidalis

![vertical muscles of the abdominal wall](https://i.ibb.co/MV22WNj/rectus.png)

### Pyramidalis

- This is a small, triangular muscle that originates from the pubic tubercles and attaches on the linea alba.
- Surprisingly, this muscle is not present in  ~20% of people
- It helps to tense the linea alba.



  

### Rectus Abdominis
- It forms the six-packðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
- This is a vertical, rectangular muscle divided by tendinous intersections (~3) horizontally and the linea alba vertically.
- It originates from the pubic crests and symphysis and attaches on the xiphoid process and the linea alba. 
- It is incompletely enclosed in the _rectus sheath_
- Blood Supply: Superior and Inferior Epigastric Vessels
- Innervation: Thoracoabdominal nerves(T6-T11), Subcostal nerve(T12)
- Functions as an incredibly powerful _flexor of the trunk_
- Also helps to compress abdominal viscera and,
- It stabilizes the tilt of the pelvis(antilordosis) 

Now, let's talk about the **RECTUS SHEATH**.

The rectus sheath is thickened fascia that (incompletely) encloses the rectus abdominis. When the aponeurosis of the flat abdominal muscles are running medially when they get to the rectus abdominis: 
- Above the **arcuate line**:  They split into two _laminae_, posterior and anterior. The posterior lamina contains the aponeuroses of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis, while the anterior lamina contains that of the internal and external obliques. Thus the rectus abdominis is completely enclosed by the rectus sheath
- Below the **arcuate line**:  All the three fibers reunite and completely bypass the posterior compartment as they only move anterior to the rectus abdominis, leaving the rectus abdominis in direct contact with the transversalis fascia

Oversimplifying things we could say that:
- The fibres of the rectus sheath completely cover the rectus abdominis above the arcuate line
- Below the arcuate line, they only cover the front (anterior)

> **The Arcuate Line of the Rectus Sheath**, also called the _Semicircular line of Douglas_ or _Linea Semicircularis_ is an imaginary curved line usually located at 1/3rd of the distance from the umbilicus to pubic crest. It denotes the limit of the rectus sheath posteriorly. It is clinically important as it is a site of weakness in the abdominal wall

Minor Note: On the internal surface of the anterolateral abdominal wall, there are 5 umbilical folds present. But since the lecturer didn't teach us, I'm sure it's not going to come out


# Clinical Correlates
- Meckel's diverticulum - Caused by incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct leading to a small intestine diverticulum (outpouch)
- Gastroschisis - Intestines herniate to external environment due to a hole (next to the belly button)
- Other Hernias
- Omphalocele
